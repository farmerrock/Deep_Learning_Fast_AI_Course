# Deep Learning Fast AI Course


### Lesson 1 — RECOGNIZING CATS AND DOGS

Welcome to the start of your fast.ai journey! In today’s lesson you’ll set up your deep learning server, and train your first image classification model (a convolutional neural network, or CNN), which will learn to distinguish dogs from cats nearly perfectly. If you need help at any time, head over to forums.fast.ai where over a thousand students are discussing the course and have provided lots of tips and tricks for you.

We learn today how to classify dogs from cats. Rather than understanding the mathematical details of how this works, we start by learning the nuts and bolts of how to get the computer to complete the task, using ‘fine-tuning’, perhaps the most important skill for any deep learning practitioner. In a later lesson we’ll learn about how fine-tuning actually works “behind the scenes”.

An important point discussed is how the data for this lesson needs to be structured. This is the most important step for you to complete—if your data is not structured correctly you will not be able to train any models.

### Lesson 2 — CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
You will learn more about image classification, covering several core deep learning concepts that are necessary to get good performance: what a learning rate is and how to choose a good one, how to vary your learning rate over time, how to improve your model with data augmentation (including test-time augmentation). We also share practical tips (such as training on smaller images), an 8-step process to train a world-class image classifier, and more information on your hardware setup (including crestle, paperspace, and AWS as options).
