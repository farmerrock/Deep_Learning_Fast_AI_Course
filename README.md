# Deep Learning Fast AI Course

### Introduction

Welcome to our fast.ai course. In this course you will be using fast.ai v0.7 in Google Colab to learn how to train a world class deep learning model using a K80 GPU for free!

[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a research project of Google whose main purpose is to help promote machine learning and education. It's a cloud environment that provides Jupyter Notebook services, and can be used without additional settings, and now offers a free GPU, which is awesome! You can use GPU as a backend for free for 12 hours at a time. The 12-hour limit is for a continuous assignment of VM. It means we can use GPU compute even after the end of 12 hours by connecting to a different VM.

### Lesson 1 — RECOGNIZING CATS AND DOGS

We learn today how to classify dogs from cats. Rather than understanding the mathematical details of how this works, we start by learning the nuts and bolts of how to get the computer to complete the task, using ‘fine-tuning’, perhaps the most important skill for any deep learning practitioner. In a later lesson we’ll learn about how fine-tuning actually works “behind the scenes”.

An important point discussed is how the data for this lesson needs to be structured. This is the most important step for you to complete—if your data is not structured correctly you will not be able to train any models.

### Lesson 2 — CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
You will learn more about image classification, covering several core deep learning concepts that are necessary to get good performance: what a learning rate is and how to choose a good one, how to vary your learning rate over time, how to improve your model with data augmentation (including test-time augmentation). We also share practical tips (such as training on smaller images), an 8-step process to train a world-class image classifier, and more information on your hardware setup (including crestle, paperspace, and AWS as options).
